# Host-pressure preflight for self-hosted CI runners.
#
# All three audiobookphile repos run on ONE macOS host, each with its own
# self-hosted runner. When two heavy jobs land at once the box starts swapping,
# the OOM killer takes the biggest process, and the job dies in a way that reads
# like a product failure: `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED on /login`, a Swift compiler
# that vanishes, a Playwright locator that never appears. Every one of those was
# already mistaken for a real bug in this repo -- see the retry-on-connection-
# refused path in scripts/e2e-library.sh, which exists because of exactly this.
#
# So the host is treated as a dependency and checked BEFORE the expensive work
# starts. Starvation is reported as starvation -- naming the actual memory hog --
# instead of surfacing two minutes later as a mystery.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/host-pressure.sh            # gate: fail fast if the host is starved
#   ./scripts/host-pressure.sh --report   # diagnostics only, always exits 0
#
# Thresholds (override per-host if the box changes):
#   CI_MIN_FREE_MEM_PCT   default 10    memory_pressure "free percentage"
#   CI_MIN_FREE_SWAP_PCT  default 5     swap free / swap total
#   CI_MAX_LOAD_PER_CORE  default 4     1-minute load average / logical CPUs

   This is infrastructure, not a regression. The self-hosted runners for all
   three audiobookphile repos share this one host, so the box is only ever as
   healthy as whatever else is running on it. Diagnose in this order:

     1. Another build on this host. A Gradle/Kotlin compile of an unrelated
        project is the usual culprit -- check the project path in the list
        above. It belongs to whoever started it; do not kill it from CI.
     2. A leftover from an earlier CI job:
          pkill -f KotlinCompileDaemon; pkill -f GradleDaemon
          xcrun simctl shutdown all
     3. Genuinely just busy: wait, or re-run once the load average decays.

   To override the gate for a deliberate one-off:
     CI_MIN_FREE_MEM_PCT=0 CI_MIN_FREE_SWAP_PCT=0 CI_MAX_LOAD_PER_CORE=999 ./scripts/host-pressure.sh
